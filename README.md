# odin-etch-a-sketch
Browser-based etch-a-sketch. Hover over the tiles with your cursor to color them in.

Passing over a tile once will color it a random color. Additional passes over the same tile will gradually darken it. A tile will darken to black in at most 10 passes, including the initial pass.

The resolution of the grid (i.e., the number of tiles along each side) can be adjusted with a slider, but the overall size of the grid itself remains constant (500 pixels squared). Once a new resolution is selected, the grid can be cleaned and redrawn with the click of a button.
